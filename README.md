<h1 align="center">volume_control_for_voicemeeter</h1>

A simple and tiny tray application that syncs the Windows volume of the `VoiceMeeter Input` device to the volume of the first virtual input strip (which corresponds to that `VoiceMeeter Input` device).

This allows the built-in Windows volume slider üéöÔ∏è, any mixer apps' sliders üéöÔ∏è as well as gestures and keyboard volume keys ‚å®Ô∏è to control the volume of Voicemeeter.

Written in Rust  ü¶Ä

### Features

* Instead of constantly polling the volume slider for changes, this app uses the built-in Windows' `IAudioEndpointVolumeCallback` interface, thanks to which, the program is **completely** idle and not using **any** CPU resources when the volume isn't being changed.
* Tiny footprint (**.77mb** exe, **0%** CPU, **2.4mb** RAM).
* The application properly unregisters with Voicemeeter's API when exiting, which prevents leaking resources and causing visual weirdness in the Voicemeeter's GUI.
* Tray icon visually consistant with that of Voicemeeter.
